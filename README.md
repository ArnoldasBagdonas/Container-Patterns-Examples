## Introduction

Containerization has revolutionized the deployment of applications, enabling efficient resource utilization, portability, and scalability. However, designing containers and orchestrating them effectively can be complex. This repository aims to provide practical examples and insights into different container design patterns that address common challenges in enterprise IT.

## Container Patterns

The following container patterns are covered in this repository:

1. Sidecar Pattern: Demonstrates how to enhance the functionality of a main container by attaching a separate sidecar container to provide additional services or capabilities.

2. Ambassador Pattern: Illustrates the use of an intermediary container to manage network connectivity, load balancing, and other communication-related tasks between containers.

3. Adapter Pattern: Shows how to use an adapter container to bridge incompatible interfaces and enable effective communication between containers.

4. Fan-Out Pattern: Provides an example of distributing workloads across multiple containers in parallel to improve scalability and performance.

5. Sidecar Injector Pattern: Demonstrates the dynamic injection of sidecar containers based on specific conditions or requirements.

6. Singleton Pattern: Illustrates how to ensure that only one instance of a container is active at any given time to maintain consistency and prevent conflicts.

7. Work Queue Pattern: Shows how to use a separate container to manage and distribute tasks or jobs to other containers in a queue-based fashion.

8. Multi-Stage Pattern: Highlights the use of multiple build stages to optimize container images by reducing their size and eliminating unnecessary build artifacts.

## Examples

Each container pattern is accompanied by a dedicated example folder containing relevant source code, Dockerfiles, and instructions on how to run and test the example. Refer to the individual example folders for detailed information on each pattern implementation.

## Getting Started

To get started with the examples, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/bagdoportfolio/container-patterns-examples.git`
2. Navigate to the desired example folder: `cd container-patterns-examples/<pattern-name>`
3. Follow the instructions provided in the example's README to build and run the container.

Make sure you have Docker installed and properly configured on your system.
